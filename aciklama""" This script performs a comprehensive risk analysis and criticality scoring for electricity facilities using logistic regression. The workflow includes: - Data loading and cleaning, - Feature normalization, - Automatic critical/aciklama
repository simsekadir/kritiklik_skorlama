"""
This script performs a comprehensive risk analysis and criticality scoring for electricity facilities using logistic regression.
The workflow includes:
- Data loading and cleaning,
- Feature normalization,
- Automatic critical/non-critical pseudo-labeling,
- Logistic regression modeling,
- Model evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC score, feature coefficients),
- Calculation of a criticality score for each facility,
- Saving the results,
- And visualizing the scores on an interactive color-coded map (red = most critical, green = least critical).

All steps are fully reproducible and modular, making the approach easy to adapt for similar infrastructure prioritization problems.
